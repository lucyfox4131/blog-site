<p>When I first started exploring code I remember learning about strings and integers and thinking "yeah, but where's the magic..."</p>

<p>I thought though I had learned the basics and knew them, and felt like I understood them, something must be coming. Something big and scary. A big dark shadow of magic that makes all those websites look so pretty and function so well. As I began Turing I couldn't wait for the magic to happen. I was so excited to learn more about what to me was a shrowd of total mystery. </p>

<p>At a certain point, you'll realize that it's not actually magic that does all these things. It feels like it a bit, but all it really is is text in files. The magic comes with the logic. People with incredible brains and logic take these basic skills and manage to create magical things.

<p>Programming is difficult. It is not easy to learn, and it's not easy to use. But, when first beginning I wish I had understood this. Everything is just text in files. And ultimately, it all boils down to ones and zeros.</p>
