<p>When I first started exploring code I remember learning about strings and integers and thinking "yeah, but where's the magic..."</p>

<p>As I began Turing I couldn't wait for the magic to happen. Though I had learned the basics I was waiting for that crazy <em>something</em> that makes all those websites look so pretty and function so well. I was so excited to learn more about what to me was a total mystery. </p>

<p>Right around week four of module one it clicked for me. I realized that programming is just text in files. And all these small bits and pieces I'd been learning could come together to start creating all those incredible websites and software programs I thought were so cool. </p>

<p>Now, while I'm no where near being able to create all those incredible things there are still some pretty cool things to be done with the basics. In fact, the things I've been able to build in just 6 weeks is pretty cool. I'm looking forward to getting to learn a little more magic.</p>
